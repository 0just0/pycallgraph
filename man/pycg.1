\fIpycallgraph\fP is a program that creates call graphs for Python programs.
\fBpycg\fP is the command line interface to \fIpycallgraph\fP's
\fImake_dot_graph\fP method, which generates a call graph and stores it as an
image in the specified image file.

Create a call graph of a standard Python installation script with command line
parameters:
.IP
pycg \-\-output-file=setup.png \-\- setup.py \-\-dry\-run install
